# app-android-sqllite
I created this app as part of a course I completed at the University of Toronto.
This is a weekly scheduler app, it allows the user to enter tasks in filed by the hour, which is saved to a database and can be retireved later on. 
This app lets the user register by creating a username and password account, which they can use to login.
Used:
- View Injection using butterknife
- Fragments and Activities
- RecyclerView widget
- greenrobot.event.EventBus
- android.database.sqlite
